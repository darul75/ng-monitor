=====================

Simple angular notification directive Bootstrap 3 style. 

It includes a small CSS3 effect, so you may guess IE6 do not like it.

*Bootstrap version 3.*

Why
------------

I had to test some CSS3 instructions and play with it.

Then AngularStrap or native Boostrap alert messages are not very friendly, popup too big, this one looks less intrusive.

This directive is fully based on angular event broadcasting, you trigger event => directive catch it.

Demo

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-notification.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-notification.min.js"></script>
```

Inject `ngNotification` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngNotification']);
```

and then just add 

```html
<notification></notification>
```

and broadcast some events to display notifications when needed

```javascript
$scope.$broadcast('notification', {type: 'info', msg:'This is ' + type + ' and it can be long message why not'});
// possible type field values are : 'primary','success', 'info', 'warning', 'danger'

```
