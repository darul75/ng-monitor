=====================

Angular directive monitoring with friendly funky status display.

Canvas mandatory.

Why
------------

Play with canvas, get simple back-office status display (server, disk usage..)

Demo
------------
http://darul75.github.io/ng-monitor/

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-monitor.min.js"></script>
```

Inject `ngMonitor` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngMonitor']);
```

and then just add 

```html
<canvas monitor id='2' w='300' h='200'></canvas>
```

and broadcast some events of that kind with percentage value:

```javascript
$scope.$broadcast('ng-monitor', {prc: val});
// val: 50 for 50%...

```
